Night driving, faced my wheel
Both of my legs replaced by steel
Lights in my eyes, a rear-view rosary
Woke up this morning with your blood all over me
My finger drew a deep red line
Shout, living without dead time
Scared, yes, that would be a fair guess
A New York City that couldn't care less

Nights in Paris, I just about died
Behind doors that locked only on the outside
Wandering hope attacked by worries
Bended, attended to by furies
Communion swallowed, my head hung
Taste of paper on my tongue
“I see nothing,” the driver said
“I can't tell if I'm alive or dead”
I'm a runaway...
I'm a runaway...
I'm a runaway...
I'm a runaway...

Hold still, keep going
Hold still, keep going
Hold still, keep going
Hold still, keep going
Still, keep going
Hold still, keep going
Hold still, keep going
Hold still, keep going

Ten to two and the highway's divided
Don't look back, my way's decided
Milk's been spilt, the wall's been built
Bones like glass and painted-over guilt
Unanswered questions I fed on in prison
Opposite fears in head-on collision
I’m the passenger, passionate, ill-at-ease
Silver teeth and psychic abilities
Roots and wires, evens and odds
Degrees of perfection, demons and gods
The loneliest hunter, fists in his pockets
Waits and distances, pistons and rockets
No going back, black afternoons, red nights
Lost in thought and caught in the headlights
Into the unknown, I better arrive
I can't tell if I'm dead or alive
what is going on beneath the surface
